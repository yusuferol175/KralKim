# KralKim
 Kral Kim is a 2D mobile board game. In this game, multiple players play a tabletop game on a single device. Players take turns selecting sticks. One player's stick is different from the others, and that player becomes the king. The king player selects two sticks and declares a penalty. The other players who possess those sticks must perform the penalty. If they fail to do so, they receive negative points, and if they succeed, they earn positive points. The king also earns points. At the end of the game, there is a scoreboard that displays the players' rankings. May/2022
